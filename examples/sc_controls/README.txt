This is the SproutCore controls example for the Lebowski framework. The SproutCore application
is located in the app directory. The scripts using the Lebowski framework are located
in the spec folder. 

To get started, go to the sc_controls_spec.rb file located in the spec folder.

This example provides an application containing all the SproutCore view that the 
Lebowski framework currently proxies. For each view shown in the application there
is a spec file demonstrating how to use the proxy.

If you have not done so already, be sure to the the frameworks README file for
important information on how to get the Lebowski framework installed and configured 
correctly before trying the hello world example.
