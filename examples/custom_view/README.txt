This is the custom view example for the Lebowski framework. The SproutCore application
is located in the app directory. The scripts using the Lebowski framework are located
in the spec folder. 

To get started, go to the custom_view_spec.rb file located in the spec folder.

If you have not done so already, be sure to the the frameworks README file for
important information on how to get the Lebowski framework installed and configured 
correctly before trying the hello world example.
